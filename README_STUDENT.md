## Reflection
This assignment helped me understand the difference between using AI casually and using AI with a professional workflow. At first, I was asking for final output too quickly, and that caused drift and confusion. Once I switched to spec-driven work, the process became much more reliable. I learned to break the project into clear phases: exploration, convergence, spec lock, sprint execution, and verification.

The biggest improvement came from writing down constraints and acceptance criteria before building. When the target was explicit, AI outputs were much closer to what I needed. I also learned the value of maintaining project memory in documentation files like `AGENTS.md`, `CURATOR_NOTES.md`, `PROMPT_LOG.md`, and `CLAIMS.md`. Those files made it easier to recover from mistakes and continue without losing context.

Another important lesson was version control discipline. By using commits and restoring previous versions when needed, I kept all assignment work while still publishing the required final pages. I now understand that the real skill is not just generating code with AI—it is managing decisions, validating claims, and shipping in small checkpoints with proof.
