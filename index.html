                    <h2>Bauhaus (1919–1933)</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar in 1919, the Bauhaus linked art, craft, and industrial production into one teaching model.
                    The school emphasized that visual decisions should follow use, not ornament, and trained students through the Vorkurs
                    foundation course before specialization. Faculty including Kandinsky, Klee, and Moholy-Nagy advanced geometric abstraction,
                    modular composition, and clear sans-serif typography across print, objects, and architecture. When the Nazis closed the
                    school in 1933, its teachers and students spread these methods internationally, shaping modern design education and establishing
                    a durable model for functional visual communication.

                    <h2>Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s–1970s)</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Swiss Style emerged in postwar Switzerland as a disciplined approach to communication design that prioritized clarity,
                    hierarchy, and objectivity. Designers such as Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann used mathematical grid systems,
                    asymmetric layout, and flush-left ragged-right text to structure information precisely. The movement favored sans-serif
                    typefaces, especially Akzidenz-Grotesk and later Helvetica, because they supported neutral tone and high legibility across
                    multilingual audiences. Its visual logic scaled effectively to corporate identity, transport signage, and editorial systems,
                    which is why the style became “international” and remains foundational in contemporary interface and information design.

                <p><strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Bauhaus because Swiss Style is a later typographic method focused on information order rather than a broad school unifying craft, architecture, and pedagogy.</p>

                    <h2>Reaction to Swiss: New Wave Typography (1970s–1980s)</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    New Wave Typography developed as a reaction to the strict neutrality of Swiss modernism, especially through Wolfgang
                    Weingart’s experiments at the Basel School of Design. Rather than reject craft, New Wave stretched it by disrupting rigid
                    grid alignment, introducing layered type, variable spacing, and diagonal movement while keeping intentional composition.
                    Designers such as April Greiman translated these ideas into emerging digital workflows, combining photography, type,
                    and color in hybrid visual fields. The movement reframed typography as expressive and temporal, proving that communication
                    could remain coherent even when structure was bent, fragmented, or visibly challenged.

                <p><strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Grunge typography because New Wave remains method-driven experimentation, while Grunge often embraces deliberate anti-legibility and raw anti-system aesthetics.</p>
