            <h2>Bauhaus (19191933)</h2>
            
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>The Bauhaus school, founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany, unified fine art, craft, and technology under one pedagogical roof. Its core principle  <em>form follows function</em>  demanded that every visual decision serve a purpose. Faculty including László Moholy-Nagy, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee developed a foundation curriculum (<em>Vorkurs</em>) emphasizing geometric abstraction, primary colors, and modular composition. The school's output  from typography to furniture to architecture  established the blueprint for modern design education. When the Nazis closed it in 1933, its diaspora seeded modernist thinking worldwide.</p>

        <!-- Swiss Style Card -->
        <article class="curator-card">
            <h2>Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s1970s)</h2>
            
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Emerging in post-WWII Switzerland, the International Typographic Style perfected the Bauhaus principle of rational design through mathematical grid systems. Josef Müller-Brockmann and Armin Hofmann championed objective typography  clarity and neutrality over personal expression. Their visual language employed asymmetric composition, flush-left/ragged-right text alignment, sans-serif typefaces (Helvetica, Akzidenz-Grotesk), and photomontage. This approach sought universal design legibility, making it ideal for corporate identity systems and public information design. The movement's influence extended globally, establishing systematic design as the international standard for visual communication through the 1970s.</p>

                    <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Bauhaus itself, because while both emphasize rationality and grids, Bauhaus was a broad educational philosophy unifying art and technology, whereas Swiss Style was a specific typographic and layout methodology focused on systematic visual communication.

        <!-- New Wave Typography Card -->
        <article class="curator-card">
            <h2>New Wave Typography (1970s1980s)</h2>
            
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Wolfgang Weingart, teaching at the Basel School of Design, challenged Swiss rationality by intentionally deconstructing the grid. New Wave typography embraced layered composition, diagonal and stepped type, mixed typefaces, and experimental layouts that prioritized expressive communication over objective clarity. This postmodern shift rejected the idea that design must be neutral and universal. April Greiman brought the movement to the United States, incorporating digital tools and photographic collage. Where Swiss Style perfected systematic order, New Wave celebrated controlled chaos  proving that breaking the rules required first understanding them deeply.</p>
