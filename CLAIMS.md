## Reflection

**One AI claim I didn't trust at first and how I verified it:**

The AI initially implied that Swiss Style and Bauhaus were effectively the same design movement, which sounded too broad. I verified differences by checking museum and design-history sources and confirmed Swiss Style is a later typographic system with specific postwar methods. I then revised the cards to distinguish Bauhaus pedagogy from Swiss information design.
