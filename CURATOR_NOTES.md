# Curator Notes: Design History Research

## Research Phase  Exploration Before Prompting

### Bauhaus (19191933)
**Initial Questions:**
- What was the Bauhaus, and why did it matter?
- Who were the key figures?
- What were the defining principles?

**Key Findings:**
- Founded by Walter Gropius in Weimar, Germany (1919)
- Unified art, craft, and technology under one school
- Core principle: "form follows function"
- Foundation curriculum called **Vorkurs** (taught by Johannes Itten, László Moholy-Nagy)
- Faculty: Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Josef Albers, Moholy-Nagy
- Visual language: geometric abstraction, primary colors, sans-serif typography, modular grids
- Closed by Nazis in 1933; faculty scattered globally, spreading modernist ideas
- Legacy: blueprint for modern design education worldwide

**Vocabulary:**
- `Vorkurs`  foundation course
- `geometric abstraction`  reduced forms to basic shapes
- `form follows function`  design serves purpose
- `modular grid`  systematic layout structure
- `sans-serif typography`  letterforms without decorative strokes

**Sources to Verify:**
- MoMA Bauhaus collection
- Bauhaus Archive (Berlin)
- V&A Museum Bauhaus exhibits

### Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s1970s)
**Initial Questions:**
- What defined Swiss Style?
- How did it relate to Bauhaus?
- Why "International"?

**Key Findings:**
- Emerged in Switzerland post-WWII (1950s)
- Key figures: Josef Müller-Brockmann, Armin Hofmann, Max Bill
- Principles: mathematical grid systems, objective communication, asymmetric layouts
- Visual language: Helvetica/Akzidenz-Grotesk typefaces, flush-left/ragged-right text, photographic imagery
- Philosophy: design should be universal, neutral, rational
- Influence: corporate identity systems, airport signage, international standards

**Vocabulary:**
- `grid system`  mathematical framework for layout
- `objective typography`  clarity over decoration
- `asymmetric composition`  dynamic balance without centering
- `Swiss grid`  precise modular structure
- `sans-serif`  clean, legible typefaces

**Sources to Verify:**
- Museum für Gestaltung Zürich
- Josef Müller-Brockmann archive
- "Grid Systems in Graphic Design" (Müller-Brockmann book)

### New Wave Typography (1970s1980s)  Reaction to Swiss
**Initial Questions:**
- How did designers rebel against Swiss Style?
- Who led the movement?
- What were the defining characteristics?

**Key Findings:**
- Wolfgang Weingart at Basel School of Design broke the Swiss grid (mid-1970s)
- Principles: experimentation, layering, collage, diagonal type, intentional chaos
- American adoption: April Greiman (digital New Wave), Dan Friedman
- Visual language: stepped type, overlapping elements, mixed typefaces, expressive layouts
- Philosophy: design as personal expression, not just objective communication
- Context: postmodern reaction to rigid modernism

**Vocabulary:**
- `deconstructed grid`  intentionally breaking systematic layouts
- `layered typography`  overlapping text and image
- `experimental composition`  rule-breaking layouts
- `postmodern design`  rejection of modernist rationality
- `Basel School`  where New Wave originated

**Sources to Verify:**
- Wolfgang Weingart archives
- April Greiman portfolio
- AIGA Design Archives

## Concept Map: How These Movements Connect

Bauhaus (19191933)
    
    Form follows function
    Geometric abstraction
    Modular grids
    
Swiss Style (1950s1970s)
    
    Perfected the grid
    Objective, universal design
    Mathematical precision
    
New Wave Typography (1970s1980s)
    
    REACTION: Break the grid
    Personal expression
    Experimental chaos

## "Not to be confused with" Draft Ideas

**Bauhaus vs. Art Deco:**
- Both early 20th century
- Art Deco = ornamentation, luxury, curves
- Bauhaus = function, simplicity, geometry

**Swiss Style vs. Bauhaus:**
- Both use grids and sans-serif
- Bauhaus = educational philosophy, broader scope
- Swiss Style = typographic methodology, corporate focus

**New Wave vs. Grunge:**
- Both reject Swiss rationality
- New Wave = controlled experimentation (still designed)
- Grunge = anti-design, raw, illegible (David Carson)

## Notes for AGENTS.md
- Constrain AI to use only verified domain terms
- Require museum-quality prose (80120 words)
- No vague adjectives ("innovative," "cool," "groundbreaking")
- Every claim must be sourceable
- Tone: authoritative, educational, precise

---

## Next Steps
1. Move key vocabulary into AGENTS.md as constraints
2. Draft cards using production prompts
3. Run Named Expert Critique (Josef Müller-Brockmann for Swiss Style)
4. Verify claims in CLAIMS.md
