## Prompt 1

- **Phase:** Exploration
- **Prompt name:** Concept Map + Vocabulary Extraction
- **What I sent:**

```
Map the relationship between Bauhaus, Swiss Style, and New Wave Typography.
For each movement list key dates, designers, principles, and 10 domain-specific terms.
If a fact is uncertain write VERIFY.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

It produced a useful timeline and movement links. Some vocabulary was too generic, so I kept only technical terms like Vorkurs, asymmetric composition, and deconstructed grid.

- **What I did with it:**

Pinned high-confidence items into CURATOR_NOTES.md and promoted the final vocabulary bank into AGENTS.md.

## Prompt 2

- **Phase:** Production
- **Prompt name:** Draft Curator Labels (Constrained)
- **What I sent:**

```
Write 3 curator cards: Bauhaus, Swiss Style, and New Wave Typography.
Each card must have an 80–120 word body paragraph, 5 domain tags, 2 real source links,
one sentence beginning "Not to be confused with..." and one accountability sentence.
Use only vocabulary from AGENTS.md and avoid unsourced claims.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

The output had strong structure but a few links were unreliable and one card exceeded 120 words.

- **What I did with it:**

Rewrote the overlong paragraph, replaced weak links with museum/archive sources, and aligned each card to assignment formatting.

## Prompt 3

- **Phase:** Critique
- **Prompt name:** Named Expert Critique (Weingart Lens)
- **What I sent:**

```
Review my Curator Card about New Wave Typography as if you were Wolfgang Weingart.
Critique the accuracy, vocabulary, and tone.
Flag anything that an expert would challenge.
If unsure about a fact, write VERIFY.
```

- **What I got back (summary):**

The critique flagged that New Wave should be framed as a controlled extension of typography, not pure chaos, and suggested clarifying its difference from Grunge.

- **What I did with it:**

Revised wording to emphasize intentional experimentation and tightened the "Not to be confused with" sentence for factual contrast.
