# CHECKPOINT_PACKET.md

## Project
- **What it is:** IS117 spec-driven portfolio build with workflow documentation and sprint evidence.
- **Chosen style:** Clean, professional, card-based layout with clear hierarchy and recruiter-focused readability.
- **Chosen stack:** Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Current Active Sprint #
- **None currently active** (Sprint 001 is completed and moved to `completed/`).

## Completed Sprints + Evidence Links
- **Sprint 001:** [project_management/completed/sprint001.md](completed/sprint001.md)
- **Receipts folder:** [project_management/completed/sprint001_receipts/](completed/sprint001_receipts/)
- **Grid screenshot:** [project_management/completed/sprint001_receipts/grid-layout.png](completed/sprint001_receipts/grid-layout.png)
- **Sticky header screenshot:** [project_management/completed/sprint001_receipts/sticky-header.png](completed/sprint001_receipts/sticky-header.png)

## Current Deploy URL
- **Primary assignment URL (Spec-Driven portfolio):** https://vangela6780.github.io/is117/portfolio/
- **Repo URL:** https://github.com/vangela6780/is117

## Known Issues / Risks
- GitHub Pages root (`/is117/`) may still show non-portfolio content depending on assignment context.
- Use `/is117/portfolio/` for this assignment submission to avoid grading ambiguity.
- Framer auth/preview was unstable earlier (`/api/v1/auth/google/false`), so deployment evidence is based on GitHub Pages.

## Next Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] If starting Sprint 002, create exactly one active sprint file in `project_management/active/`.
- [ ] Keep scope bounded to sprint goals only.
- [ ] Add verification pass/fail entries before marking sprint complete.
- [ ] Move completed sprint to `project_management/completed/` with receipts.
